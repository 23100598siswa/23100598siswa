## Hi there 👋

👨‍💻  I’m a Master’s student in Software Engineering, passionate about learning, designing, and building efficient, scalable, and maintainable software solutions. As a full-time student, I’m actively engaged in coursework, refining my technical and problem-solving skills to tackle real-world software challenges.

📚 I’m currently learning: Machine learning concepts, from foundational algorithms to real-world applications, with a focus on how AI-driven systems can enhance software development and automation.  

⚡ Fun fact: I have a deep interest in AI and robotics! I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can be integrated into software engineering to create adaptive, efficient, and autonomous solutions. From machine learning-driven software to robotics applications, I’m fascinated by how AI enhances automation, optimizes decision-making, and improves the scalability and maintainability of modern software systems.  

🎯 Course expectations: I aim to gain hands-on experience in designing, maintaining, and evolving software systems. I’m particularly interested in understanding best practices for software architecture, scalability, and sustainability. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in software engineering principles while applying them to real-world projects, ensuring that the software I build is efficient, maintainable, and adaptable to future advancements.
